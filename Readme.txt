Below is the original license that came with the A-7E model on which this model is based.  It was released as Freeware, Non-Commercial.  This model cannot be sold, and cannot be used for commercial use.

I've converted this model to AC3D format, redid the landing gear, cockpit, external stores and some textures. Added refueling probe.  The DavePack set of instruments and effects is needed.
